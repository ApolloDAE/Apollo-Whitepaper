# Apollo-Whitepaper
Apollo's living whitepaper and Business POA --

## Preamble

This paper has been prepared by the Apollo DAE team and may be updated as needed. Most topics discussed in this paper may change over time or become irrelevant as technology, business and trading evolves.

Apolloâ€™s primary goal is to create a digital asset exchange (DAE) platform that provides advanced yet easy-to-use trading tools, a liquid trading book, market and trading information, market protections from malicious traders, advanced security, and 24/7 reliable customer support. We have many more plans and goals than just these few, but these are the main features we aim to incorporate before opening Apollo for trading.

We apologize in advance for the length of this paper. Reading it in its entirety may prove tedious to some, especially to those who do not understand the technical side of the technologies we use. Our exchange is no small feat and has a lot of moving parts that need to be addressed so that all token owners know what we want to bring to the public. Some sections will be condensed to keep topics brief since entire novel-size documents could be written for some sections of this paper.
