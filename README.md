# Apollo-Whitepaper
Apollo's living whitepaper and Business POA --

## Preamble

This paper has been prepared by the Apollo DAE team and may be updated as needed. Most topics discussed in this paper may change over time or become irrelevant as technology, business and trading evolves.

Apollo&#39;s primary goal is to create a digital asset exchange (DAE) platform that provides advanced yet easy-to-use trading tools, a liquid trading book, market and trading information, market protections from malicious traders, advanced security, and 24/7 reliable customer support. We have many more plans and goals than just these few, but these are the main features we aim to incorporate before opening Apollo for trading.

We apologize in advance for the length of this paper. Reading it in its entirety may prove tedious to some, especially to those who do not understand the technical side of the technologies we use. Our exchange is no small feat and has a lot of moving parts that need to be addressed so that all token owners know what we want to bring to the public. Some sections will be condensed to keep topics brief since entire novel-size documents could be written for some sections of this paper.

## Exchange Problems

#### Lack of good customer support

Most of Apollo&#39;s team is made up of cryptocurrency investors and traders that use exchanges such as GDAX, Poloniex, Bitfinex, Bittrex, CHBTC, YUNBI, and more. Some have even tried less popular exchanges like Liqui, BitShares, CEX, and Cryptopia. With most of these exchanges, you get no immediate customer support  and instead they make you wait for an email response that could take days, weeks or, especially with GDAX, 3 months. Can you imagine using a bank, stock broker or forex broker that is impossible to contact when you need them most? When that happens, you would leave and find a new bank, broker or trading platform. In the cryptocurrency world, users want to find another option, but they are stuck with what is available. Everyone settles on a subpar exchange since it&#39;s the best they can get and nothing better is available.

#### Low liquidity

Then there is the main issue with smaller exchanges: nearly no liquidity. You can only trade $100 at a time on these small exchanges without running the risk of buying higher or selling lower than the market average of an asset. It could take years for a small exchange to get enough users to increase the liquidity on their books. It&#39;s the main hurdle new startup exchanges have to face. They may have a better platform with a few more features, but it may take years for users to migrate to the exchange since they can&#39;t offer the volume users need to trade without massive price swings.

#### No market information

With almost all exchanges, no market information is provided. Go to any exchange and look for information on assets such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum and you will find that they probably don&#39;t tell you what it is, how the coin or asset works, what makes it popular, where is it being used, or what its future is. You can even visit the asset&#39;s website and not find all of that information. We agree that users need to do their own research on assets, but we also think that an exchange should provide information on coins that are trading on their platform and keep that information up to date with any news. This allows for an informed trading market instead of users making impulsive decisions.

#### Market manipulation

If you trade assets regularly, it is always advised to protect your positions by using stop-loss sell orders. You may also choose to set an order to buy an asset at a certain price. These are great, except when someone with malicious intent comes in and sells or buys a massive amount of coins, which then creates a cascade of sell or buy orders to get filled, causing an asset&#39;s price to either skyrocket or drop to nothing. This is greatly magnified when an exchange offers margin trading. There are many other types of market manipulations, including but not limited to: pump and dumps, churning, wash trades and spoofing (another major issue).

#### Exchange and customer security

With more exchanges popping up, some may wonder what security measures the exchanges use to protect their company and user funds. Most will choose to keep a big portion of their funds offline in cold storage and hold 10% - 30% of funds in a hot wallet. This is great, but not sufficient. Exchanges need to implement security standards better than the standards used by banks, stock markets and forex markets. They should encrypt everything, change keys frequently, restrict access to keys directly, store keys on hardware security modules, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA), change passwords regularly, and takes steps to prevent phishing.

Overall, the best advice any long-term cryptocurrency holder gives new investors is: &quot;Don&#39;t leave your coins on exchanges.&quot; We want to provide a more viable alternative to this. Users on Apollo will have their funds protected and secured better than most of them could do by themselves.

## Exchange Solutions

### Customer Support

All customers, whether they have millions or just a handful of dollars, will have access to quick customer support when needed. Digital asset trading never stops, and there will be times that urgent help is needed. We think that most exchanges stopped providing reliable support because of the amount of repetitive questions that customers ask, even though an answer could have been found if a customer searched through the exchange&#39;s Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) or knowledge base. Customer support is a massive expense because of this. However, this should not justify limiting or even not supplying support. We have a few solutions that may used on Apollo. Some ideas may be controversial, but may fix customer support scaling issues while also providing urgent support. These idea&#39;s are not perfect, and our initial goal is to provide 24/7 support for any issues. This however may exceed budgets and a new system would have to be used to stay within budget to at least provide urgent support when needed and 2-3 days support for anything else.

##### Option 1: Support categories and limiting users who abuse the system

Providing customer support for an exchange is a big task. There will be a massive amount of requests, questions and issues, all needing a different approach by our staff. We want to give our customers the ability to categorize their support issues in level of importance and speed of response needed. Customers would be able to label their support requests as &quot;Urgent&quot;, &quot;Help Today&quot;, &quot;Help Soon&quot;, or &quot;Standard Support and Questions&quot;.

*Here is an example of what we mean.*

**Customer Albert:**

Albert places a limit order for 10 Bitcoin. The site freezes on his end (this shouldn&#39;t happen on Apollo, but we cannot absolutely guarantee that bugs won&#39;t rarely occur), and after monitoring other exchanges&#39; Bitcoin price, he realizes Bitcoin will soon be going down 10% in value! What should he do? On any other exchange he would have to either wait for the site to come back online, email their support and wait months for a response or do nothing. On Apollo, we will have a support site run separately, so that if the exchange does go down (which won&#39;t happen unless most of the internet goes down), then Albert could go to support, request &quot;Urgent&quot; support and then a chat session will start up and put Albert in line for help (with around a 0 - 10 minute wait). Albert talks to an agent, gets his limit order canceled before Bitcoin drops, and everything is great.

**Customer Robert:**

Robert uses Apollo, sees that we added a new coin to the exchange called Oxo (for example). He wants to know more about Oxo, so his first thought is to contact Apollo&#39;s support staff. He goes to our support page, selects &quot;Urgent&quot; support. He gets connected to an agent, asks what Oxo coin is, and the agent explains what it is and where to find more information. The agent then marks Robert as an abuser of the system for one month, which means that he can&#39;t select &quot;Urgent&quot; support again for that time period. He abused the system by using &quot;urgent&quot; support for a question that could have been answered on his own, and was non-urgent. If robert could not find an answer to his question, he should have used standard email support.

Later in the week, Robert sees that Oxo is trading at $5 when it&#39;s trading at $4 on another exchange. He wants to know how this is possible. He goes to Apollo&#39;s support, but the only options he has is &quot;Help Today&quot;, &quot;Help Soon&quot;, &quot;Standard Support and Questions&quot;.

Again, Robert chooses the fastest option: &quot;Help Today&quot;. No chat this time, so instead he needs to write out his question in a form and submit it. A staff member responds in a few hours, explains that some exchanges have completely separate order books and the other exchange doesn&#39;t use Apollo&#39;s exchange connections and unified order book. The agent then marks Robert as a level 2 abuser, which lasts for 2 months, since he could have easily found this information in our FAQs or labeled it as a &quot;Standard Support and Questions&quot; request.

Eventually, one day Robert has a massive problem, but his only option is to use &quot;Standard Support and Questions&quot; and according to Apollo&#39;s stated time of response, it will take up to 5 days to get a response. He shouldn&#39;t have used urgent support chat and emails to get answers about questions that are not urgent, especially when his answers could have been answered by reading the FAQs. He decides to send the email with the slowest option, since it&#39;s the only one available to him. Fortunately, we use AI for tracking if an email may be urgent and his email is flagged as urgent. A staff member responds and fixes Albert&#39;s issue within the hour. This won&#39;t always be the case, since machine learning isn&#39;t perfect, and even if a message is flagged as urgent, our staff may be too busy with other support requests that are labeled as urgent by users.

We hope that this would discourage users from requesting urgent support when it is not actually needed. 
**This will be the way we run our support team when Apollo opens for trading.**


##### Option 2: Offer support with categories and require a deposit

If our support system ends up being abused too often and it costs Apollo more than we make in revenue to support all of our users, then we will use this option. We would use the aforementioned support option and combine it with the support pay options below. Users can still label their support request as &quot;Urgent&quot;, &quot;Help today&quot;, &quot;Help soon&quot; or &quot;Standard Support and Questions&quot;. However, any &quot;Urgent&quot;, &quot;Help Today&quot;, and &quot;Help Soon&quot; cases would require a deposit in order to be accessed. This deposit will be based on current levels of support requests, and will also be higher for &quot;Urgent&quot; requests. Typically, we would see this deposit being around $1 - $10, but it could be higher or lower. These deposits will be returned if the user did indeed need urgent help. If they request anything but standard support just to ask a question that has answers all over the web or in our FAQs, the deposit will be kept as a fee to pay our support staff. Below is what we will generally require the nature of each request to be in each category. However, these are just guidelines and each case will be evaluated individually.

**_Urgent_** : Order issues that could cost money if not cancelled immediately, hacked accounts, unauthorized withdrawals, trades, etc.

**_Help Today_** : Withdraw or deposit issues, trading issues.

**_Help Soon_** : Semi-urgent questions that don&#39;t have answers online or in our FAQ.

**_Standard Support and Questions_** : Pretty much anything.

**Pay for support that could have been solved without requesting support**

A massive amount of customer support, based on our experience, comes in the form of &quot;stupid questions&quot;. These questions may be asked because a customer is confirming if information they found is correct, but most of the time it&#39;s because a customer refused to read FAQs, do quick Google searches, asking Siri, or do any sort of research that would have answered their questions in a few minutes. It&#39;s great for people to ask questions, but unfortunately it costs companies money for their time and labor to respond. We propose charging customers a fee to initiate a support session, but the fee will be returned if their questions or needs couldn&#39;t have been solved without the help of Apollo&#39;s support team. This would hopefully incentivize users to read and do their own research first before requesting support.

**Pay for urgent support**

Another option is to have users pay for really urgent support. We do not like this idea. However, it may be necessary to offer it if a customer feels they are not getting enough help in a timely manner. This could happen when an increase in support wait time occurs, but a user needs urgent help for an order, transfer or some other issue, and the current wait time is too long. The user would then pay a larger fee to get help sooner, and would then be refunded if their situation did indeed need urgent help.

**Pay for manager (or higher) support**

Another situation may arise when Apollo&#39;s support staff has done everything they could to help a customer, but the customer still isn&#39;t satisfied. Instead of telling a customer we will no longer help them with an issue (because our support staff has done everything they can) we could offer them paid support by a member of Apollo who has more access in the company (example: I want to talk to your manager!). This option would be similar to the pay for unnecessary help and pay for urgent help options. We would charge a support fee upfront and if their situation ended up not being frivolous, the fee would be refunded. The reason for the fee in this situation is the fact that most customer issues can be fixed with customer support staff and, unfortunately, some users may think that a manager would do more to help them. In some rare cases this could be true, but our normal support staff would know whether a manager is needed or not and if one is, we would involve the manager without charge.

Overall, we think charging a fee up front for support would drastically limit unnecessary emails, chats and phone calls. Charging for urgent help would let users know we are there when they need us, but if you say something is urgent and it&#39;s not, you&#39;ll be charged. In the rare case a user wants to speak to management, they can, but they will have to pay for our time if their issue was fixed as best as it could by support staff.

_These &quot;payment for support&quot; ideas will not be implemented when we initially open for business. This would only be our fallback approach if costs for customer support end up being too much for the company to pay for._

### Low Liquidity

Many exchanges fail as soon as they launch and the biggest cause of this, besides bad customer support, is that the exchange has a low volume of orders. This is to be expected since they just started and it would take time to attract more customers to their platform. Eventually, if they offer better services and features than other exchanges, liquidity may not be an issue. Low liquidity opens exchanges to market manipulations and flash crashes, resulting in customers leaving to use other platforms for trading.

What is considered low liquidity? GDAX and Kraken flash crashes have shown us that low liquidity can even mean having millions of USD on the books. Even with all of those millions, there was still not enough volume of orders for a user to trade against.

##### How can Apollo provide more liquidity than the biggest exchanges?

We are building a network to connect multiple exchanges together in one order book, sharing orders across exchanges. Every exchange right now typically has their own order books, separate from all other exchanges. Fortunately, there are multiple ways for exchanges to share order books to increase liquidity, either directly and indirectly.

**Arbitration**

Arbitration is when one user buys an asset on one exchange and then sells it on another exchange at a higher price. This is possible because exchanges are typically separate order books with their users determining the price of asset differently than on another exchange. Without arbitration traders, the price of digital assets would vary widely between exchanges.

Apollo will employ a slightly altered but similar strategy to initially connect Apollo users to a massive amount of other traders. We will try to explain this as best as we can without giving too many details that could be used against Apollo by malicious traders looking to take advantage of our system.

{{ Will add chart }}

_Example:_

Apollo has corporate account with *Exchange A* and *Exchange B*, referred to as **XA** and **XB**. Both **XA** and **XB** have trade volumes totalling 200 million USD daily. Apollo puts 20 million in company funds in both **XA** and **XB** exchanges: 10 million in USD and 10 million USD equivalent in Bitcoin.

On Apollo&#39;s exchange, **XA** and **XB&#39;s** order books are shown to apollo users (combined together with Apollo&#39;s books). So if **XA** has 1,000 Bitcoin selling at $5,000, **XB** has 300 Bitcoin selling at $5,000 and Apollo users want to sell 200 Bitcoin at $5,000, then, on Apollo, it will show a total of 1,500 Bitcoin for sale at $5,000. If a user, or multiple users, on Apollo go to buy 1,500 Bitcoin at market value (which would be at $5,000/coin), then they can, and in the background 200 Bitcoin would simultaneously be bought on Apollo, 1,000 on **XA** and 300 on **XB** using Apollo&#39;s company trading accounts with **XB** and **XA&#39;s** API.

Therefore, with market orders, Apollo traders could buy and sell with more volume to buy and sell against, and therefore provide less slippage of price.

**What about limit orders?**

Limit orders would work the same way. In the same scenario, let&#39;s say that users on Apollo want to buy 1,500 Bitcoin at $4,999 instead of at $5,000. They put the order in and a 1,500 Bitcoin buy order would show on Apollo&#39;s order book. In the backend, Apollo will put buy orders for 1,000 Bitcoin on **XA** and 300 Bitcoin on **XB**. If **XA** ends up selling 800 Bitcoin in one go, then we would add another 150 Bitcoin to the buy orders on **XA**, reduce the buy order on **XB**, and reduce the total buy order on Apollo down to 700 Bitcoin. Then, if 700 Bitcoin gets sold off on Apollo, the orders on both **XA** and **XB** will be canceled instantaneously. From this example, only two exchanges touched $4,999 before Bitcoin rocketed to $6,000. If a user tried buying 1,500 Bitcoin from any one exchange, their order would partially fill on some and not fill on others at all. Using Apollo, we work to match orders from a lot of exchanges to our customer orders.

*Now, obviously, our system is much more complicated than this.* There are hundreds of scenarios that could happen and we are building our system to adapt to every one of them. We will be using the strategies of multiple experts to build our system to ensure we give our customers the most liquidity possible.

Modified arbitration isn&#39;t the only option Apollo will be using to connect with exchanges. It will only be the last option if an exchange refuses to work directly with us.

**Securing connections with smart contracts**

Working directly with other exchanges to provide our users and the other exchange&#39;s users with more liquidity will be the ideal solution. There are different ways to handle relationships with different exchanges, and contracts typically won&#39;t be the same for all of the exchanges we make deals with. The basic idea would be for us, Apollo, to put collateral in a smart contract that would allow exchanges to collect from it if we don&#39;t settle accounts on an regular basis. Let us explain this better.

One way connections are secured with funds in a smart contract:

{{ Adding a picture }}
```
XA -> Buy 5 BTC @ 5,000/USD | XB -> Buy 5 BTC @ 4,999/USD
Few minutes later
XC -> Sell 8 BTC @ 5,005/USD | XA -> Sell 2 btc @ $5,000
```
For Apollo to spread out user trades on our platform, we will need to own both the underlying asset being traded and the asset being trading to.

For example:

(To make this simpler, we will assume that Apollo has no orders on our books and all trades are relayed to other exchanges.)

If User A wants to buy 10 Bitcoin, then we will try to get him the best price by buying 5 Bitcoin on XB and 5 Bitcoin on XA, equalling an average price of $4,999.50 per coin. A few minutes later, Bitcoin hasn&#39;t moved much so User A decides to market sell the 10 Bitcoin. Apollo then sells User A's 8 Bitcoins on XC and 2 Bitcoins on XA at an average price of $5,004 per coin. Doing this multiple times in a day will result in prices being equalized across exchanges, and provide our users access to massive liquidity. However,Many of you can see one big issue with this already: How do we get User A's bitcoin to our exchange, and then move the 10 Bitcoin back to XA and XC to sell?

The short answer is that it&#39;s not possible, currently. To connect trading across multiple exchanges with multiple assets, using arbitration-type trading, Apollo would have to have near-unlimited funds in multiple denominations. Instead, we have to enable a way to let exchanges know we have the funds to trade with without actually keeping those funds on the exchanges. With escrow type smart contracts, we can put collateral into a contract and give special access to all exchanges. This access would allow the exchanges, at any time, to withdraw collateral from the contract up to the amount owed by Apollo. It would still require Apollo to own the assets our users trade with, therefore, we would only enable high liquidity for certain assets, and not necessarily all assets available to trade. For this reason, we will try to allow as many different assets to be sent in exchange for DAE during our ICO sale. This way Apollo can enable high liquidity trading with multiple assets instead of just one or two.

{{adding diagram to explain better}}

### Market Information

**Coins, tokens and asset information**

All exchanges seem to assume that users know everything about the assets they allow their users to trade. They don&#39;t provide much information about an asset, and therefore users have to Google and search around to find more information on an asset they don&#39;t know much about. Sometimes it could take a while to research new assets, cross-check facts, and weed out hypes and gossip. We want to provide asset information to users so that they can quickly see at least the following basic information:

- An asset&#39;s main and secondary objectives.
- All places the coin can be used.
  - Exchanges.
  - Used as currency.
- How many developers are involved in the project and when the project was last updated.
- When the coin plans on running updates.
- Any coin updates.
- Any security issues.
- Market cap, transactions per day and value.
- News, market sentiment, and more.

We also want to provide a place for traders to get market updates that may affect the assets they trade. We will be teaming up with other companies to help provide this information.

**Market manipulations**

All exchanges are riddled with market manipulations right now. It is to be expected since crypto assets are still relatively new to the world. Users can be anonymous on some exchanges, and exchanges can experience days of low liquidity, prime for manipulators. Our main focus is to stop market crashes, reduce pump and dumps, reduce spoofing and make Apollo a safe place to trade assets without having to worry if you are getting forced into a trade by manipulators, which can cause substantial loss among traders.

**Market crash protection**

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has had massive flash crashes, but they immediatley figured out how to protect traders from flash crashes. They do so by banning groups and single traders from orchestrating a massive sell-off or buy-ins caused by enabling a sequence of cascading stops and margin calls from other unsuspecting traders. NYSE also uses multiple circuit breakers and other techniques. Apollo will implement advanced crash protection for our exchange even though preventing a cryptocurrency flash crash is more complicated since cryptocurrency assets tend to be more volatile than traditional stocks.

{{ Adding picture to explain }}

If a user or group of users tries to initiate a sell or buy of an asset that would result in the price of that asset to fluctuate more than 5 - 20% (percentage will be determined by market information of all exchanges at the given time), then the market order will automatically be purchased by Apollo at the effective rate the user or groups of users would have gotten if their market order had been allowed on the exchange.

For example: A user tries crashing Bitcoin&#39;s price on a specific exchange. The price of Bitcoin is at $5,000 per coin. On the books, the user has to sell more than $20 million to force the price down past 15%. The user estimates that this price drop would cause stops and margin calls to trigger and cascade. Eventually, the user decides to force the price down even more, to below 20%, by selling off $40 million in Bitcoin. Before he does so, he puts in buy orders for Bitcoin at $1,500, $1,000, $500, $100, and maybe even lower. He puts in the $40 million sell and watches the market crash, allowing him to buy back btc at cheaper rates. He makes a fortune since the price goes down to $1,200 and then jumps back up to $5,000, all in mere seconds.

That&#39;s what happens on other exchanges, but this won&#39;t happen on Apollo. Using the same setup, he tries crashing the price on Apollo, but, instead, he sells his Bitcoin for an effective rate of ~$4250 per Bitcoin and the market didn&#39;t move, except maybe 1%.

So what happened? Our system flagged the trade (or trades), processed it as usual at whatever price it would have been filled if it was released on the open market, but filled the orders against Apollo&#39;s funds. Then Apollo sold a small percentage of the Bitcoin on Apollo and other connected exchanges over a few seconds to a few minutes to reduce a market fluctuation and Apollo&#39;s exposure. Eventually all of the bitcoins were sold off slowly, preventing a flash crash. Again, it is more complex than this.

And to be clear, this will not stop an asset&#39;s price from rising or dropping more than 5% in minutes if all exchanges are seeing the assets price drop or rise. Our market crash system will only detect massive orders executed within seconds of one another and monitor all the other exchanges&#39; prices simultaneously. If, on other exchanges, the asset&#39;s price does drop past 5 - 20% at the same time the user mentioned in the example above sells, then their order will be allowed to fill. The only thing our system does is to insure an asset&#39;s price stays within 5 - 20% of the total market average since we believe anything more or less would be a manipulation attempt. If the overall market price does drop past 5, 10, 20, and 50% very quickly, it most likely is a massive market manipulation attempt, but it could also be a mass panic sell due to an underlying problem of the asset in question. The asset could also be part of a massive pump and dump scheme, in which case there is not much that we could do. Because of this, we will not allow assets that we believe are fundamentally flawed or could be party to pump and dumps, to be traded on Apollo.

**Spoofing**

Spoofing is the act of putting in large buy or sell limit order(s) without the intent to let the order(s) be filled. Instead, the intent is to force other traders to push the market in the opposite direction of that massive buy or sell spoof order. In stock and forex markets around the world, spoofing is illegal. Because crypto exchanges are unregulated, spoofing is permitted and market manipulation is widespread. At Apollo, we will employ techniques to counter spoofing. However, since our order book is connected to other exchanges, our actions against spoofing may not be sufficient to prevent it.

Our first action is to detect when spoofing occurs. In trading, it may be hard to know 100% of the time if spoofing is occurring, but we generally believe that a user is trying to spoof an asset&#39;s price when massive orders are added to the books and then taken off the books when the market price touches or gets close to the massive orders. (This is just one small piece used to detect spoofing. To protect our system from manipulation, we won't disclose all techniques used to detect spoofing.)

*Second action:* Any time we see a user account do this, we mark their account as a possible spoof and hide all of their orders over a certain amount from all other Apollo traders. The spoofer will still have their orders filled, but the order size won&#39;t be shown on the front-end. An account will be labeled as a spoofer as long as our system detects that they are trying to spoof. We won&#39;t limit accounts or freeze accounts over this, since drastic actions like that won&#39;t be necessary with our anti-spoofing features in place.

*Third action:* Inform all Apollo users about spoofing: what it is, how it manipulates prices, and what the outcomes of spoofing has on an asset&#39;s price. If all (or most) users understand that massive buy or sell orders could be an attempt to get them to pump or dump an asset for the spoofer, then spoofing may eventually not affect Apollo traders&#39; decisions as much.

Our final action is to convince exchanges that are connected to us to employ similar anti-spoofing systems.

**Pump and dumps**

We are glad to see the widespread use of blockchain and cryptocurrency assets, and it&#39;s great to see new coins being made for new purposes. However, there are probably around 10 illegitimate coins for every legitimate coin out there, giving traders a lot of opportunities to take part in the pump and dumps of some of these illegitimate coins. The only way we see to avoid having coins pumped and dumped on Apollo is to not list and allow coins that could easily be manipulated with such actions. Some factors that make a good pump and dump coin are: low market cap, low user usage, small or nonexistent developer team, widespread forum talk about pump and dumping the coin, and massive social media spreading of propaganda to make a coin seem amazing. &quot;You need to buy CHC, it&#39;s going to the moon!&quot; No CHC coin on Apollo until it proves itself.

**Exchange security**

Typically, the first piece of advice that most new users to crypto receive is: &quot;Don&#39;t leave your coins on an exchange.&quot; This is partly due to the Mt. Gox exchange that was hacked years ago, Bitstamp and Bitfinex that were recently hacked around a year ago, and a few other exchanges on top of that. We agree with the advice and do agree that your funds are not safe on the majority of exchanges out there, whether they be big or small. The only exchange that we are 99% certain is reasonably protecting your funds from theft is Coinbase (GDAX). We want to make it safer for crypto holders to keep their coins on Apollo versus in their own wallets.

The first step is fighting hackers and theft of assets by regulating private key storage and access. There is a long list of good security practices and how to keep private keys secure, but it would be best to not make this paper any longer than it already is, so here are just a few key points:

- Use multi-signature wallets
- rate limiting
- decentralized storage
- Restrict key access
- Don&#39;t let anyone know your private key or the password that encrypts it

It&#39;s a no-brainer that an exchange wallet needs to employ multi-signature access, no matter whether the storage is &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot;, but a lot of exchanges seem to think that this is not necessary. We think it is and will only be using multi-signature wallets that require four or more key signatures to approve customer withdrawals. This system is a lot more complicated than what we could effectively explain in words, so here is a picture:

{{adding pic}}

Basically, we have a hot wallet that only holds up to 5% of customer funds at one time. This wallet has 8 private keys issued, 4 of which are kept offline in separate vault locations in case of hardware malfunction or failure. 1 key is given to a third party organization, such as BitGo, and is used to finalize a withdrawal. The other 3 keys will be distributed to separate Apollo servers in separate locations and stored on a hardware security module (HSM). These keys will be almost immune to hacking and theft due to how HSMs are built to operate. The only weak link is the code that tells the HSM module to sign a transaction. This code could hypothetically be hacked if a hacker gets into our servers in one location and is able to bypass 2FA security, decrypt our server&#39;s information, figure out how interact with our HSM module at that server location, and get it to sign a transaction (which is very, very unlikely, but we like to plan for everything). Just in case a hacker can somehow manipulate our exchange&#39;s transaction records that are kept in our database or our private blockchain or bypass encryption used on all our systems, they would still have to hack into 3 or more server farms, located all over the world, and then convince the third party signer to agree to a massive withdraw that doesn&#39;t match the trading history that they would have access to as well. We don&#39;t want to say unhackable, but we think that we&#39;re very close to it.

This, of course, is just a small portion of what will actually be implemented. We didn&#39;t want this paper just to be about how to secure and exchange (although it is a major part of the operations of an exchange). Instead we want to focus on Apollo as a whole. In summary, the main requirements for a secure exchange are: use multi-signature wallets, use HSMs, keep records of all transactions on a private blockchain, keep private databases in multiple locations, use a third party to finalize withdraws, and give that third party real-time data feeds that they will backup as well to ensure withdraws are not exceeding user&#39;s deposit amounts after trading. And, finally, encrypt everything all the time. Nothing should ever be unencrypted in storage, on a server or in a transmission period.

We will also be working with insurance companies to insure our exchange and your funds in the rare (and nearly impossible) case of theft if the high level of security doesn&#39;t put your mind at ease.

**Customer Security**

An exchange&#39;s backend security is only good if customers&#39; access to their accounts are secure as well. Unfortunately for users, using just a username and password is not safe these days. 2 Factor Authentication is the new standard to verify an account owner is the one logging in or requesting a withdrawal. 2FA is great until you realize that the exchange logs you out automatically every 30 minutes due to inactivity and it takes an extra few minutes to log back in. Additionally, what happens when you lose your 2FA device or (if you&#39;re using a phone) you accidentally wipe your phone and are now stuck locked out of your account. There are a lot of difference scenarios that may cause users to lose access to their account or get their account hacked, so what can a user do?

On most exchanges, they give users the option to send an email to them saying that your account was hacked or they lost their 2Fa, but a response could take days, weeks or even months. This isn&#39;t good, and exchanges are essentially punishing their users if they lose a 2FA device or get hacked and can&#39;t do anything urgently to save their funds and account. We will be fixing this problem in a few ways, and will be changing the way you log in for Apollo.

**Get rid of logins**

There are a few new startups promising better login experiences for customers and it&#39;s Apollo&#39;s primary objective to implement a concept like this for our users. We are currently working with Remme.io and Civic on the login technologies they offer, with Remme offering the best idea yet. Remme will link your account to your specific device, leaving logins in the past. 2FA would still be required for most user actions, but Remme has a better solution for that as well. If we can iron out the few issues that we see with using Remme then it will be the primary option we will use for customer account access.

**Use Facebook and Google+ logins**

Facebook and Google have greatly improved their login security, so much that we believe they would be perfect for accessing your Apollo account. 2FA would still be required for most account actions, but we think using a Facebook or Google login would be more secure than having a user sign in with just an email/username and password since Google and Facebook have better machine learning and could detect a bad actor much better than we could.

**Blockchain logins**

We may also integrate the ability to allow users to log in using their wallet to sign a message or to use a Parity or MetaMask Ethereum wallet. This option is still being investigated.

With any of these login types, we will still implement machine learning and monitor IP access, timestamps, browser/device fingerprints, typical account actions and workflows, fund actions, and more. Overall, we take security very seriously and wish other exchanges would too.

### Plans After Opening Apollo to Traders

Our solutions and goals to achieve before opening Apollo are just a small piece of Apollo&#39;s bright future. Unlike most exchanges, we won&#39;t stop innovating and updating our platform to implement more technology to help traders. We want to add industry-standard trading tools like MT4/MT5, increase user chart and tool experiences through heatmap tracking technologies and a/b testing, expand data centers all around the world to ensure our exchange won&#39;t have downtime from issues due to failures, internet problems, hacking, and overstepping governments. Add instant deposits for trusted users, add fiat withdrawals and deposits after getting registered, and give users an option to trade instantly without an account and just use wallet to wallet transfers. We also want to work with newer and smaller exchanges by providing white label trading API&#39;s, wallet services, and security. The list can go on, but then we would be giving away business plans that we don&#39;t want the competition to know just yet, including one very awesome order type that has never been implemented, anywhere.

**ICO Token problems**

New ICOs are popping up every day, which can either be great for innovation or end up causing more problems than what they&#39;re fixing. We have been following many ICO projects and have noticed there are a lot of great projects, as well as a lot of near impossible projects, along with the typical scam projects. Almost all projects, however, set out to raise way too much capital with their ICO and then leave their investors wondering what the raised funds are being spent on. It&#39;s also widely speculated that most ICOs will fail to launch because their projects are either technically impossible, run by inexperienced members, and/or funds get wasted on unnecessary expenses.

A more recent issue for ICOs has been hackers stealing their funds or siphoning funds from investors by passing out non-legit Ethereum addresses. Some of these wallet thefts and website hacks could have easily been avoided, but the ICOs were started by inexperienced people (who may also cause the project to fail later on). Even if a group does have the necessary experience, their token contracts were made from a generic ERC 20 standard and not much thought or effort had been put into their contracts. Did these hacked ICOs have even just one auditor check their work?

All of these problems get ignored over and over by investors, and we think it has to do with the way ICOs allocate tokens to investors. The typical ICO sale uses an early investor incentive program. Be the first to invest, get more tokens than everyone else. Be the last to invest, get shafted. This approach only works in favor of the company raising funds and the first investors to send coins. It does not typically benefit any other investors and usually causes massive blockchain congestion. Wall Street is famous for using this approach, and it has worked for a long time. Maybe there isn&#39;t such a big issue with this approach, but we don&#39;t like it, therefore we won&#39;t be running our token sale this way.

### Apollo&#39;s ICO Token Sale Solution

Our token sale is a completely new concept to ICOs, which we hope will pave the way for future ICOs to operate better. To start off, let&#39;s first explain why we need funds and how our tokens will work.

In order for us to bring Apollo to an operational state, we will need to raise funds to cover the costs of starting a massive exchange.

This is a small list of where raised funds will be needed at first:

- Pay team members (such as the developers) to finish building our full exchange.
- Have expert security advisors help us implement secure protocols and use the best security practices.
- Purchase and/or hire the infrastructure needed to run Apollo securely in multiple locations and build a secure private blockchain as a backup reference for all transactions.
- Make connections with existing exchanges.
- Legal and license fees.
- Auditing services.
- Customer support setup.
- And much more.

To raise the funds we need, we will be selling &quot;DAE tokens&quot;, aka Digital Asset Exchange tokens. These tokens will have many uses for buyers (unlike many other ICOs out there), but our main objective is for the DAE tokens to be used to pay fees on Apollo, for now. We are setting up our platform to automatically charge a user in DAE tokens for any transaction they initiate on our exchange. This includes, but is not limited to: exchange fees, withdrawal fees, customer support fees\* and deposit fees\*. (\*May not be added to the exchange in the first place.)

A user does not have to own DAE tokens in order to use any of Apollo&#39;s services. However, based on how we are setting up DAE pricing, it would be beneficial for a user to own DAE before using Apollo as it would save the user money. If a user does not own DAE, then Apollo will charge the user the standard fee rate and then Apollo will purchase DAE tokens to cover the user&#39;s fees. It&#39;s almost that simple... but not completely.

When Apollo has to purchase DAE tokens to cover fees by a user who does not own them, Apollo must buy the DAE tokens at market price or at the minimum set asset price (whichever is higher). If the market price is higher than the set minimum asset price, a simple market buy will be executed on Apollo&#39;s exchange.

Example: User A trades 1 Bitcoin for 10 Ether. The standard fee rate at that time is 0.2%, and they have no DAE tokens. Their fee of 0.02 Ether is charged automatically by Apollo. Then Apollo will take that 0.02 Ether and buy DAE tokens with a market order. The DAE tokens will then be frozen for future token sales.

Using the same example, if the market price had been below the minimum asset price for DAE, then Apollo would hold a *"buyback"* event every hour, that will purchase DAE tokens back from any holder at the minimum asset price, up to the amount of DAE tokens need to settle fees for users that did not have any DAE tokens to pay fees.

Example: User A&#39;s fee of 0.02 Ether needs to be used to buy back DAE. However, the market price is below DAE&#39;s M.A.P. (discussed below), so Apollo opens a quick buyback event. Any user with DAE tokens can sell their tokens to us, up to 0.02 Ether. First come first serve.

**What is M.A.P. (Minimum Asset Price)?**

In the sales industry, M.A.P. stands for Minimum Advertised Price. Most people don&#39;t know this term, but it means that a reseller can&#39;t advertise to sell a product below the manufacturer&#39;s M.A.P. price, and the reseller is usually not allowed to sell a product below MAP, privately or publically.

We use the M.A.P. reference since we see DAE as an Apollo product. As a product, we want to ensure our buyers that we will honor certain asset prices on our exchange as compared to market values. At the end of our ICO, the minimum asset price for DAE will be set at 120-400% the price that DAE tokens are sold to ICO buyers. This does not mean DAE will instantly be worth double, nor does it guarantee a buyer can profit off of this. What M.A.P. does guarantee our token buyers is that when they use their token to pay their fees on Apollo, their DAE is worth more than they purchased them at in the ICO. In simple terms, DAE holders will save more than 50% on fees, on Apollo.

*__Example:__ DAE ends up selling for $10 per DAE in the ICO. Therefore the M.A.P. will be $20.*

User A trades 1 Bitcoin for 10 Ethereum, the fee is 0.2%. That would result in a fee of 0.02 Ether. If Ether is trading at $500 per coin, the total fee in USD would be $10. Now assume that User A owns 10 DAE. As exchange fees, his 10 DAE are worth $200. Therefore 0.5 DAE is deducted to pay his fee instead of deducting 0.02 ETH. He then owns 10 Ether instead of 9.98 Ether that he would have had had he paid his fees only using Ether, but now he owns only 9.5 DAE. If he bought DAE during the ICO, he would have only paid $10 per DAE token, meaning that this fee costs him $5 instead of $10. This is not including the discount DAE tokens holders get on fees.

{{ Diagram coming }}

MAP will change based on a few rules that are currently not set in stone. We would like to see how the DAE market price trades in comparison to the MAP pricing before setting exact guidelines on MAP price increases and decreases. What we do know for sure is that the MAP price will not be allowed to be set under the **ICO sale price**. We are also confident that the MAP price should never need to be decreased, and should only increase over time. Our current plans are to increase the MAP rate after collecting a set amount of fees from Apollo transactions.

MAP pricing is a new concept for digital assets, and so we can&#39;t be 100% sure what will happen with DAE&#39;s price on the open market. DAE&#39;s price could go way up or way down and therefore caution buyers not to purchase DAE for investment purposes since DAE&#39;s price in the open market may be unpredictable, as with any other digital asset. With that said, we assume DAE&#39;s price will at least trade closely to the minimum asset price or above it. We base this assumption on the fact that Apollo has to purchase DAE at the minimum asset price to cover fees of users who do not own DAE, and if the market price of DAE is lower than the M.A.P., arbitrage traders would most likely take advantage of this and buy DAE in the market and sell to Apollo when we open up buyback opportunities every hour while market prices are below M.A.P. There would be no reason for DAE to not trade above M.A.P. since we would then be forced to buy DAE at market price. Again this is all speculation, and anything is possible. For most users, DAE should just be used to save on exchange fees.

#### A Second ICO Token Bonus - Avo

Wait, what...? Yes, you read that right. We are issuing 2 tokens in our ICO DAE sale (at no extra cost for the second token). You will not only get DAE tokens, but also AVO tokens. AVO stands for Apollo Voting Tokens (not avocado, in case you were wondering). However, the AVO tokens will have no market value. They will not be transferable and their only purpose is to be used as a voting system. AVO is being made to assure ICO buyers that we will not waste their capital from the ICO sale. Yes, it&#39;s a big issue with ICO&#39;s right now: companies are raising funds and then doing whatever they want with the funds raised. With no accountability, and projects end up failing. We want to appease any worries and assure token buyers that we are headed in the right direction and that the control is in their hands.

**What does Avo do**

After the ICO, Avo holders will have to vote to allow Apollo to use company funds.

Let&#39;s walk through the steps on how voting will work. Reading the section on Smart Contracts for Apollo, below, will also help you to understand how our Ethereum contracts work.

We expect 50% or more of the funds invested in our ICO sale to be in Ether. The rest of the funds raised will be in Bitcoin and various other altcoins. The Bitcoin and other altcoins will be left in cold storage until Apollo&#39;s platform is operational. Then, at some point in time, the Bitcoin, altcoins and some Ether will be used as collateral to connect to other exchanges (and not be expensed). The Ether and DAE tokens that are in our smart contract will be our main source for paying employees, contractors, businesses and operational costs. Our smart contract is built to not allow any transfers unless an owner holds a vote and the AVO holders approve the transfer within the given voting timeframe. If AVO holders vote no, then a transfer is declined and we would have to either try explaining to AVO holders the purpose of the transfer a little more or move on. This voting system is also used to secure our contract from hackers. Since AVO tokens are non-transferable, a hacker would have to own the majority of AVO tokens at the time of the crowdsale, which would take a lot of equity to achieve, and it still would not give a hacker access to our smart contract funds since they would need the contract owner&#39;s keys to initiate a transfer.

Transfer process:

1. Owner initiates a fund transfer proposal with a set timeframe (minimum 24 hours).
2. AVO holders have until the end of the timeframe to cast their vote using their wallet.
3. AVO holders can cast a yes or no vote directly or can then can delegate their vote to another user.  An AVO user can at any time change from delegating their vote to voting directly. Every time an AVO holder votes on the same proposal, their vote will be changed to the newest/latest vote.
4. At the end of the vote, AVO holders who voted will be paid in DAE tokens for voting.
  1. This payment amount with be based off the amount of funds being transferred, current business profits (if any), length of vote time, number of voters needed, and possibly a few other factors. Voters will be notified of the amount of DAE they will receive for voting before a transfer proposal is opened.
5. Users who delegated their vote will get paid 50% of the DAE tokens, and the delegate will get the other 50% of that users paid DAE tokens for voting.
6. If the vote is a yes, funds from subcontracts will be allowed to transfer to our main contract wallet. After transferring to our main wallet, funds can then be transferred anywhere by having at least 50% of the owners agree to the transfer. Then the transfer will be held for 24 hours at which time any two owners can cancel the transfer (this is for security reasons). If 90% of owners&#39; keys approve a transfer from the main wallet, then no waiting period will be needed

{{ Picture coming }}

The AVO tokens&#39; voting rights can be updated at a later date to allow AVO holders to vote on the company direction instead of just on fund transfers. Additionally, after Apollo gets to full operation and is running for at least a year, AVO voting on fund transfers may be disabled if they no longer are needed, but only if token holders agree on this decision. If voting on fund transfers is no longer needed, AVO voters and owners can vote to unlock AVO to be transferable and tradable.

AVO tokens are only for buyers that purchase DAE tokens during Apollo&#39;s ICO. AVO tokens can not be acquired after the ICO and is recommended to buy DAE tokens during the ICO in order to get the bonus AVO tokens, as well as buy into DAE at the best average market price. The token sale will be explained below.

**Apollo Token Sale Dynamics**

Apollo&#39;s token sale will consist of two parts: a modified Dutch auction and a demo trading market. This may sound confusing, but we will try to explain this as best as possible. We are creating this token sale style in order to give all investors the chance to acquire DAE tokens at a fair average market price.

_Apollo&#39;s token sale is open to any citizen of the world unless your country prohibits buying virtual goods from a United States corporation. (North Korea?)_

**Part 1 - The modified Dutch auction**

We are letting token buyers determine the price of DAE paired against USD using a two part system. When we open our ICO for deposits, buyers will have to provide 3 quick pieces of information.

**#1** - A number between 1 - 10,000 that is the USD price per DAE that will be used to determine the buy price of DAE tokens in the Demo market

{{ pic }}

```

(( Your deposit in USD * your price vote ) + ( every user's deposit in USD * their price vote )) / total USD deposit amount.

```

This figure above is calculated at the end of one week of open deposits. The average price per coin that buyers vote on will then be used as the starting price pof DAE in our demo market, starting a few days after the first week of deposits ends.

**#2** - Buyers will need to provide their Ethereum address that we will be sending their DAE tokens to. This Ethereum address will need to be a wallet address that they have full control over and know the private keys of. Examples of such wallets are Parity, MetaMask and MyEtherWallet. We allow any token buyer to send Ether from any wallet, even exchanges. We also will accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, and other altcoins. Because we accept deposits from many types of sources, users will have to provide their Ether wallet address so that our smart contract will know where to send their tokens after the ICO.

**#3** - Provide information on what the buyer would like to do in part 2 of our ICO. By default, any buyers that deposit funds during the first week of our ICO will automatically purchase DAE tokens at the average voted price per coin when we open the demo market. Buyers can choose to not automatically buy DAE tokens when the demo market launches.

Once all of this information is provided, a buyer can then choose what coin they want to deposit with. For example, selecting Ether will take them to a new page that will give them an Ethereum address to deposit to. Any deposits from any wallet or exchange will automatically be counted towards the total USD value of their deposit, that will eventually be used to calculate how many tokens that buyer will get after the ICO. This will be the same for any coin deposit. (Buyers may have to use an ETH wallet to make a subcontract for their ETH and ERC20 deposits instead of using our website to easily get a deposit address. This may be needed due to the price it cost to make a subcontract)

After a deposit address is displayed and the user confirms that they&#39;ve sent their deposit, the user must create an account for Apollo&#39;s demo market if they want to trade DAE on the demo market. If a buyer doesn&#39;t want to participate in the demo market, they can choose not to make an account on Apollo. To make an account with Apollo, all the buyer has to do is log in using Facebook or Google. As long as the user logs in with their social media while on the deposit address page, that address will be linked to their Apollo demo market account. We have chosen not to require buyers to sign up for the demo market before getting a deposit address to make purchasing DAE less complicated for those that just want to buy DAE.

**Part 2 - Demo market opens**

Our demo market is our way to give buyers the ability to test out trading on a very basic demo platform. This platform will not be Apollo&#39;s operational platform, but instead has been created specially for the ICO and will provide us with information for building a more complete platform.

Our demo market will allow buyers to trade DAE against USD using the funds they have already deposited, or they can also deposit funds during the open demo market and trade with that. The start price of DAE is determined by averaging the voted price that buyers choose when depositing funds during Apollo&#39;s first week of their ICO. All buyers that automatically buy DAE tokens without having to trade for them on the demo market will automatically start with a proportional number of DAE tokens (calculated by dividing their total USD deposited by the average DAE voted price). Buyers could override this default option in part one and choose to start with a USD balance instead of DAE balance when our demo market opens. Buyers that don&#39;t deposit during the initial week in part one, or want to add more funds to buy more DAE tokens, can do so at any time during the demo market.

**What is the purpose of the demo market?**

We are running a demo market for a few reasons, but the main idea is that it will give buyers a chance to set a fair average market price for the DAE tokens and that price will be used to distribute tokens to all buyers after the demo market closes. In part one, buyers have to vote on the price they want DAE to be. That average calculated price may be a fair price to offer at, and to insure that it is, we will open the demo market at that price and then see what happens from there. After the demo market closes, the average trading price of DAE will be calculated and used as the final price that DAE will be sold at to the demo market buyers.

**Get more DAE per USD**

With the demo market, buyers will have a chance to get more USD to buy DAE at the VWAP (volume weighted average price). To do this, a buyer can trade DAE on the demo market and gain more USD than initially deposited. If a buyer ends up with more USD then deposited after the demo market closes, then that final USD balance will be used to purchase DAE at the final VWAP. If a buyer's USD balance is lower than the amount of USD they deposited, then their deposit amount will be used to buy DAE. Therefore, it is beneficial to participate in the demo market as you could earn more USD to buy DAE, but not loose USD. This is our bonus system, and could be subject to change if we were to run out of DAE tokens.

**Not getting any DAE?**

There is a chance that you could lose out on getting any DAE tokens, but we think the chances are slim. Since only 50 million tokens will be sold during our ICO, some buyers may not get a chance to buy DAE if we do run out of tokens to sell. This will be hard to track during the ICO and we will not know if there are too many purchase orders in USD versus the total supply of tokens times the VWAP. After the demo market closes, the VWAP will be calculated together with the total buyer deposits in USD. If the total deposits equal more than 50 million tokens times the VWAP, then we have to adjust bonuses or refund buyers.

1. We will decrease bonuses for buyers, or even remove bonuses in order to include more buyers in our token sale.
2. If removing bonuses is not enough, then we will start refunding buyers who deposited last during the demo market, up to the first depositer during the demo market.
2. If we still do not have enough DAE to distribute, we will start refunded buyers based on the amount they voted on during the ICO's first weeks, starting with buyers who voted for the smallest price.

**How refunds will occur**

Since our smart contract is built to be very secure and we are open for deposits from multiple sources like exchanges and wallets that are not owned by the buyers, we cannot build a function that will automatically refund deposits that are paid using any crypto that is not Ether or sent using Shapeshift. Instead, we will add a page to our website that will have a searchable list of all the Ethereum addresses of the buyers that need to be refunded. These Ethereum addresses are the addresses we requested that buyers provide for their tokens to be sent to.

If a buyer&#39;s Ethereum address is on the list, that person will have to provide a refund address for the coins they used to deposit initially. They can do this easily using the wallet that their Ethereum address is linked to, to interact with our smart contract. This is only needed if the user deposited any coins that are not Ethereum and did not use Shapeshift to deposit.

Any buyer that does deposit with Ethereum or with Shapeshift will be refunded Ether automatically to their Ethereum address that they listed as the token receiving address and not the wallet address that the Ether or altcoins were sent from.

**After the ICO**

After a successful ICO, tokens will be released within few days after the demo market closes after we audit deposits, review the market, calculate the VWAP and refund users (if needed). Once the tokens are released, buyers will be able to do what they want with the DAE tokens. We will be working with a few other exchanges to have DAE available for trading after we release the tokens.

Apollo will continue work on our full exchange and will actively seek to hire more team members since our project will require more customer support agents, developers, server technicians, and security experts. We expect to open for trading in the early months of Q1 in 2018. During our build process we will have multiple expenses and, as said before, will require AVO holders to vote to allow expenses to be paid. There will be one initial transfer of Ether that should be around 5 - 20% of Ether received that will not require AVO holders to vote on. This Ether will slowly be sold off over the course of the next 1 - 2 months (we will do it slowly as to minimize the effect on Ethereum&#39;s price). The USD from that will be used to guarantee that we can pay employees, suppliers, contractors, businesses and operation expenses in case the price of Ether, and other coins collected during the ICO, crash and take a while to recover. During any crash in price, we would revert to using that USD to pay for expenses versus having to use ETH and DAE. The money will be kept safe in multiple banks.

Additionally, any coins that are not in the smart contract, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple and others, will be locked into cold storage until Apollo opens for trading. Any transfers of Ether after the initial transfer will require AVO holders to vote and allow them.

_In the very rare event that Apollo can&#39;t become operational, we will refund all token buyers in proportion to the amount of deposits left after paid expenses._

### Apollo Smart Contract

Anyone will be able to review our Apollo contract prior to opening our ICO for deposits. We encourage everyone to look it over. We will also have the contract audited a few times prior to our ICO. Currently, our contract is still being developed; however, we are confident that it will be finished and audited in the next few weeks, prior to our ICO in September/October. If there are any major problems or recent hacks of other projects, we may delay launching our ICO in order to make sure our contract is 100% secure. We want to get Apollo up and running as fast as possible, but will not risk getting hacked or being open to hacks and losing funds, just to save a month or two of time. That being said, let&#39;s try to explain how we are setting up our smart contract.

{{ adding contract diagram }}

Our smart contract will consist of one main contract and thousands of sub-contracts. Every time a user requests an Ether or token deposit address, we will supply them with a unique address just for their deposit and nobody else&#39;s. This address will be a sub-contract of Apollo&#39;s main contract and it can only withdraw Ether or tokens if the main contract requests the transfer. Additionally, Ether or tokens can only be transferred to the main contract and nowhere else. We use this strategy to increase the security of funds and to keep track of each buyer&#39;s deposit and their vote during the initial ICO week. (This may be changed due to contract costs. Buyers may have to request their deposit address using an ETH client and creating a subcontract. This porcess is fairly easy, but would require a user to take additional steps to link their deposit to their demo market account.)

The subcontract will be ERC20 compliant and can accept Ether or any other ERC20 token from any wallet, even exchanges. This is made possible because we require buyers to submit an Ether address that they own which will be used as the address we send their DAE tokens to.

We will also accept deposits in other denominations, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple and more. These deposits will unfortunately not be a part of our smart contract, unless a buyer uses the Shapeshift service on our page to deposit altcoins. If a buyer uses Shapeshift, their coins will be converted to Ether and deposited into a subcontract. We do not want to discourage anyone from depositing Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, and other non-Ethereum altcoins directly to Apollo without using Shapeshift or converting them to Ether. When Apollo becomes fully operational, we will need to have Bitcoin, Litecoin and other altcoins in order to connect to Apollo to other exchanges. It is also beneficial for us to diversify the coins being deposited into our ICO because holding too much of one coin could be devastating if its price drops too much. However, if you want your funds to be secured in our smart contract system and have voting control over expenses of your funds, then deposit Ether, ERC20 tokens or use Shapeshift. We do not recommend using Shapeshift to deposit ERC20 tokens, since our smart contract can already accept them.

**Parts of the sub contracts:**

- Constructor function that takes users&#39; USD vote on DAE price and saves it.
- Withdraw function that allows only the main contract to withdraw Ether to the main contract
- Transfer function that can only be called by the main contract which will transfer tokens stored at this address to the main contract.
- Event that fires whenever Ether or tokens are transferred to or from this address.
  - This is used by our monitoring system to detect Ether deposits for the ICO.
  - It will also be used to detect unauthorized Ether or token withdrawals, in which case our system will freeze all funds until we can detect if there was a hack and how to fix it.

Most parts of the main contract:

- Function to distribute all DAE tokens to buyers and the Apollo team.
  - This will need to be called by an owner after clearing the distribute proposal.
  - This function will distribute all tokens based on the approved proposal below.
- Distribute tokens proposal.
  - Owner must call this and get majority of owner keys to approve.
  - 24 hours wait is added to this proposal before approval.
  - Any two owner keys not approving this will stop the proposal.
  - Master owner key can stop proposal.
  - Initiator must define a map of every single token address and the amount they will receive.
- Standard withdraw function that is only allowed if a majority of owner keys are used to initiate a withdrawal.
  - This is used to withdraw funds only stored in the main contract, which is typically nothing until tokens are transferred from subcontracts to this main contract.
  - This function can only be called 24 hours after an initial formal withdrawal request.
  - A withdrawal amount and &quot;to&quot; address has to match a withdrawal request.
- One time initial subcontract withdrawal.
  - This is used after the ICO by majority of owner keys in order to pull 5 - 20% of tokens from subcontracts to the main contract. These funds will be sold off to provide for Apollo backup funds if token prices drop.
- AVO approved withdrawals.
  - Any withdrawals from subcontracts will have to be approved by AVO token holders and owner keys. Once approved, any owner can call this function once with the approved withdraw amounts and from which subcontracts to pull from. Once tokens are in the main contract, the owner can call the standard withdrawal function.
- Formal withdrawal request.
  - This can only be called by an owner. It will take the amount of withdrawals requested and to what address.
  - An event will fire off to alert us of a pending withdrawal. Any withdrawal request that is not pre-determined will cause the wallet to be locked until we can verify if we have been hacked or not. Any requests can be canceled by two owner keys at anytime.
- Vote initiation.
  - Any owner can start a vote to allow a subcontract transfer of tokens. The owner must include the subcontract addresses to withdraw from and the amount of tokens from each. Additionally, the owner must specify how long to keep a vote open (minimum is 24 hours, default is also 24 hours). Only one vote can occur at a time.
  - AVO token holders can then call to this contract and vote yes or no.
    - One yes cancels out one no, and one no cancels out one yes.
    - There needs to be more yes votes than no votes. The percentage of majority needed will be determined by owners as well as how many AVO holders will be needed for a majority vote to be considered. (Example: If 10% of AVO holders vote yes, and nobody votes no, this may not be considered a majority, and this transfer request would fail. If 30% of users vote yes, and 20% vote no, this may be considered as approved.) Threshold numbers can vary and be changed by owners if they notice voter turnout rates start lowering.
    - After a vote closes, AVO tokens holders are then paid a set amount of DAE per AVO. This amount can be set by the owners.
  - After the set time period, anyone can close the vote and see the results. If the results allow a transfer, then an owner can call the transfer after getting majority owner key approval.
- Add or delete owner keys and proposals.
  - Majority of owner keys must approve within 24 hours.
  - Master owner key can override all changes requested (master key is locked in a vault).
  - Master key can be changed if all owner keys agree.
- Multiple functions to log the balances in subcontracts if requested.
- Function to calculate subcontract vote averages.
- Function to allow an owner to refund tokens accidentally sent to this contract back to original senders.
- Future functions currently locked out (must be individually voted to unlock by AVO token holders).
  - Ability to extend this main contract by whitelisting and using another contract made by Apollo. Such extensions could be:
    - Ability to increase AVO token holders voting rights to beyond just token transfers.
  - Ability to add transfer functions for AVO holders.
  - Split DAE tokens by increasing or decreasing total supply.
    - This may be useful in the future to lower DAE token prices.
      - It could be confusing to pay a fee on Apollo, and the fee is 0.0000003234 DAE. We prefer fees be close to whole numbers like 1.94 DAE.
    - Would basically increase or decrease every holders balance by a factor given to the function.
  - Remove AVO voting needed to transfer funds by owners.
    - It may no longer be useful to have AVO holders vote on every transfer in the future.
  - Change owner keys.
    - In case keys are lost or compromised.
    - Master owner key can stop any changes.
  - Change subcontract owner address.
    - The subcontract owner addresses may need to be changed if updating this contract to a new address.
    - Master owner key can stop any changes.
  - Ability to migrate to a new updated contract if needed.

### The End is Here!

It&#39;s time for action! We will no longer settle with using non-customer friendly and focused exchanges, and so should you. We will not invest in ICOs that don&#39;t take security seriously and use dirty tactics to create massive uninformed bad investments or token purchases by offering investors more funds for depositing one second before another investor, and so should you.

Thanks for reading our whitepaper and plan of action. We hope you will join our ICO and participate in the token sale. If you have read this whole paper, all the way to here, great news! Follow and then private message your Ether address to our CEO, Benjamin McDaniel, on Twitter to get free DAE tokens after our ICO. You must PM him before our ICO ends in order to get free DAE. Ben will be giving out 1% of DAE split equally to anyone who PM&#39;s his twitter account, from his share of tokens. It&#39;s his reward to you for staying informed about our ICO. Twitter: @benjismarket or @apollodae. Make sure to include your ETH address and a short phrase identifiying that you want the free bonus. During our ICO, we will have buyers PM our twitter, slack, facebook and email to verify their deposit address for our ICO is a real address controled by Apollo and not a scammer address. Sorry for the lack of pictures, we will be adding some shortly.
